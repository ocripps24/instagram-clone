# instagram_clone

A new Flutter project.

## Process & Credits
The objective was to build the front end/UI side of the first page of the Instagram app. This is an imitation build following a One Day build video a this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uEfOls4e4

I have also reviewed the original developers source code for the project here: https://github.com/KalleHallden/Instagram 

The objective was to develop some further exposure to the exciting new Flutter framework following a previous project of building a clone of the Netflix UI.
